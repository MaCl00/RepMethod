# RepMethod
 An Automated Repertoire Method  
 Requires MatLab and the Symbolic Math Toolbox Add-On.
# ToDo
 - ~~Nonhomogenous recurrence equations~~ Done
      - ~~Algorithm exists, needs to be implemented~~
 - ~~Finding an upper limit for the precision~~ Not possible, unless restriction on user-functions
      - ~~Does not exist jet, should be trivial with proof of condition, stability, and consistency~~
 - ~Eliminating non-relevant Terms~
      - ~~Algorithm exists, needs to be implemented~~
      - ~Since there is no upper limit for the precision, this will be harder than expected~
 - Continuing the search after the first solution
      - Algorithm exists, needs to be implemented
 - Determinating if there does not exist a solution
      - ~Algorithm does not exist jet, a promising idea does exist~
      - Algorithm exists, needs to be implemented
 - Providing options for combinations of functions
      - Should be trivial
 - ~Adding a verbose flag for all progress-updates~
