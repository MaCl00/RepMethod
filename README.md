# RepMethod
 An Automated Repertoire Method  
 Requires MatLab and the Symbolic Math Toolbox Add-On.
# ToDo
 - ~~Nonhomogenous recurrence equations~~ Done
      - ~~Algorithm exists, needs to be implemented~~
 - Finding an upper limit for the precision
      - Does not exist jet, should be trivial with proof of condition, stability, and consistency
 - Eliminating non-relevant Terms
      - Algorithm exists, needs to be implemented
 - Continuing the search after the first solution
      - Algorithm exists, needs to be implemented
 - Determinating if there does not exist a solution
      - Algorithm does not exist jet, a promising idea does exist
 - Providing options for combinations of functions
      - Should be trivial
